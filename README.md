# QLearning

1. What is Q Learning? What does the Q stand for (and what about the "Learning")?

Q Learning is a generalized algorithm that is meant to teach AI how to act. It is particuarly used when an AI is attempting to learn one very specific goal, rather than generalized knowledge or action/reaction. It works similarly to Psychology's Behaviorism, in that actions are given a specific reward based on a specfic action. In a way, it is a form of operant condition.

2. What is RL (Reinforcement Learning) and how does it relate to ML (Machine Learning)?

Machine Learning is similar to Classical Conditioning, while Reinforcement Learning is similar to Operant Conditioning. Machine Learning uses a specific algorithm to acheive a specific goal, and thus the computer can make a prediction about what will happen, and will get better over time either through experience or a tweak to the algorithm. Reinforcement Learning on the other hand focuses on a computer receiving a "reward" or the lack there of, and learning because of it. The computer is tasked to want to receive this reward, and as different rewards are given out for specific outcomes, the machine learns what to do and how to act, kind of similarly to how a child would learn how to act and behave.

3. What does it mean for Q Learning to be "model-free"?

Q Learning does not use an example, or a model, in order to learn and develop. Rather through directly interacting with the environment, the AI is meant to learn and develop. In a way, it is a "hands-off" approach to AI development.

4. What, if anything, is Q Learning often used for? (If you find any cool projects or research relating to Q Learning, feel free to link them to me!)

Making Games with Specific Procedures (think board games or connect 4), Robotics / Kinesthetics, Sorting and Organization, Economics (think estimating stock prices, managing savings, etc.), Automatic Driving Vehicles and Plane Tech, etc.
